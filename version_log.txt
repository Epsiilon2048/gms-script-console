Version 1.1.0 - Colors

Additions
 - Console text colors! Hopefully this will give users a better idea of what is and isn't supported.
 - Hovering your cursor over the console object text now shows the instance ID and location
 - The esc key now exits out of the console
 - Refined the readme file - most notably added the Integration section, which hopefully gives better
   insight for how to integrate your code with the console
 
Fixes
 - The instance cursor (which shows which object you're selecting when using select_obj) has been moved to 
   the draw GUI event
 - As such, the draw_instance_cursor function has been updated to work in the draw GUI event rather than 
   the regular draw
 - select_obj now properly removes the inst_selecting_name variable from the display when finished
 - The when set to the log, the window now cuts off long strings to be more readable. This isn't a great 
   fix, but probably better than nothing.
 - Made other adjustments to the log window
 - The display now removes variables once their instance no longer exists
 - The string_split function no longer uses DS lists
 - Fixed string_is_float and string_is_int to work with signed values
 - Fixed some scripts to automatically scope the console
 
Known issues
 - Sometimes the color parser appears to add a space. This is only in very specific instances which would
   throw errors anyway. You can disable the text colors by setting the console's console_colors to false.
 - Text color parsing doesn't separate via semi-colons
 - In some cases, the window doesn't respond to the mouse. I'm not sure what causes this, but you can fix 
   it by enabeling the display. Probably a simple scripting issue, and I'll figure it out when I have more 
   time.
 - Commas are ignored when on the ends of arguments, but still require spacing between
 - The help command still kinda sucks
 
And of course some scripts were tightened up. I intend for the next update to address some of the
readability issues the code currently has. The main addition for that update will likely be hotkey
support.
