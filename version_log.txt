Early release 1.2.0 - Text embedding

Wow, this update is disproportionately huge! That's why it's an early release at the moment, wanted to
make a quick break point. This update, as far as I know, is perfectly functional. The main issue is that
I had to disable the log as a quick fix to a memory leak issue.

Additions
 - Added embedded text--text which can be colored or clicked to run scripts - It's pretty costly though,
   and you might want to disable it (embed_text in the console objet) if it's a problem
 - Completely revamped help command, now has much more info and clarity
 - Added console customization options
 - Added color scheme presets, which can be found in the console menu
 - Added the bind function, which allows the binding of keys to console commands or scripts
 - Added the addvar and togglevar functions which change the values of variables - this is a quick 
   solution for incrimenting variables with binds, and I hope to add proper operation support in the 
   future.
 - Greatly expanded the supported macros to include keyboard keys
 - Made the Window and Display into Console_window structs - and the output can be displayed as a console
   window as well
 - Added the report function, which returns the longMessage of the previous script error
 - Updated the readme document
 - And probably a lot of other stuff I'm forgetting

Fixes & changes
 - Fixed the display function to now properly toggle variables off
 - The output_set function now displays arrays as top-down lists to the user
 - Updated various command names and descriptions for clarity
 
Known issues
 - Sometimes the color parser appears to add a space. This is only in very specific instances which would
   throw errors anyway. You can disable the text colors by setting the console's console_colors to false.
 - Text color parsing doesn't separate via semi-colons
 - Command text parsing manages strings very poorly
 - Commas are ignored when on the ends of arguments, but still require spacing between
 - 0 doesn't show up as real with the colors
 - Console window constructors are not autonomous
 - Weird console window logic causes problems sometimes
 - Embedded text cursor detection occasionally thinks the mouse is over two embeds at the same time,
   though only one embed can be activated at a time; it's more of a visual issue
 
To do before major release:
 - Rewrite the console text parsing
 - Add support for structs
 - Fix log
 - Impliment the list of outdated commands to be colored in a certain way
 - Update and smoothen out some commands
 
=====================================================================================

Release 1.1.0 - Colors

Additions
 - Console text colors! Hopefully this will give users a better idea of what is and isn't supported.
 - Hovering your cursor over the console object text now shows the instance ID and location
 - The esc key now exits out of the console
 - Refined the readme file - most notably added the Integration section, which hopefully gives better
   insight for how to integrate your code with the console
 
Fixes
 - The instance cursor (which shows which object you're selecting when using select_obj) has been moved to 
   the draw GUI event
 - As such, the draw_instance_cursor function has been updated to work in the draw GUI event rather than 
   the regular draw
 - select_obj now properly removes the inst_selecting_name variable from the display when finished
 - The when set to the log, the window now cuts off long strings to be more readable. This isn't a great 
   fix, but probably better than nothing.
 - Made other adjustments to the log window
 - The display now removes variables once their instance no longer exists
 - The string_split function no longer uses DS lists
 - Fixed string_is_float and string_is_int to work with signed values
 - Fixed some scripts to automatically scope the console
 
Known issues
 - Sometimes the color parser appears to add a space. This is only in very specific instances which would
   throw errors anyway. You can disable the text colors by setting the console's console_colors to false.
 - Text color parsing doesn't separate via semi-colons
 - In some cases, the window doesn't respond to the mouse. I'm not sure what causes this, but you can fix 
   it by enabling the display. Probably a simple scripting issue, and I'll figure it out when I have more 
   time.
 - Commas are ignored when on the ends of arguments, but still require spacing between
 - 0 doesn't show up as real with the colors
 - The help command still kinda sucks
 
And of course some scripts were tightened up. I intend for the next update to address some of the
readability issues the code currently has. The main addition for that update will likely be hotkey
support.
